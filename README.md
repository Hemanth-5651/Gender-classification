# Gender-classification

Based on the training of model i am going to predict wheather the person in thee image was male or a female one is determined

I have usen the following pre required essentials
->Inception_v3: it is a image recognization model
->usage of keras from  tensorflow
->conversion image to array[our model accept only numerical array] use the  ->tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image 
->clone the male-female-face-dataset
process:
->create a model and train the model
->capture image using the javascript code
->pass the image to our model
